This is the source code for the demo of an app.
In this demo, there is a menu scene, the level 1 scene and the help scene.
The level 1 and help scene are all connected to the mainmenu scene via buttons.
This app depicts a treasure hunt in which the player has to solve questions related to programming and logic to proceed further.
If the answer is correct then, the player will unlock a path in maze to the next question.
This will continue till the time the player doesnot reach the treasure placed in the middle of the ground.
Once the player has correctly answered all questions in the level, then he/she will be able to open a path towards the treasure.
